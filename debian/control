Description: GNOME thumbnailer for ELF executables with embedded icons
 A native C thumbnailer for GNOME that generates thumbnails for ELF
 executable files. It can extract embedded icons from ELF files using
 the elficon utility and libr library, or create informative fallback
 thumbnails showing the architecture and executable type.
 .
 Features:
  * Extracts embedded SVG icons with full color depth
  * Creates professional gradient fallback thumbnails
  * Fast native C implementation using Cairo and librsvg
  * Integrates seamlessly with GNOME file manager
 .
 This package integrates with GNOME's thumbnailing system to provide
 rich visual previews of executable files in the file manager.
